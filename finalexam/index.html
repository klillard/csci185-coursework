        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Katelyn, and I created this website for my CSCI 185 final and decided to theme it to
        my interests and assignments. </p>

    <h2>Family & Friends</h2>
    <p>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on March 28th, 2003. I moved to Huntersville, NC in May of 2005. I lived in Huntersville for 16 years
    before moving to Monroe, NC. I graduated high school in June 2021, and went to UNC Asheville a few months later.
